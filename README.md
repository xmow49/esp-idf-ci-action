## How to specify a custom version of ESP-IDF

GitHub does not support the specification of the Docker image tag as a variable.
It's the official limitation. To select the specific version of ESP-IDF you
can reference a specific version of GitHub action:

```
uses: espressif/esp-idf-ci-action@latest
uses: espressif/esp-idf-ci-action@4.2.1
uses: espressif/esp-idf-ci-action@release-v4.3
```

Each of the tags marks the corresponding branch of this repository.

## Add a new Docker tag for the action

Docker image tags from https://hub.docker.com/r/espressif/idf/tags.
Each Docker tag is stored in branch with prefix "branch-" and has tag same as in Docker.

The new branch can be added by following the PowerShell script:

```
./Add-IdfTag.ps1 -IdfTag "v3.3.3"
```
